August Cohort Hackathon 1 - Portfolio Section
This repository contains a portfolio section added by Musa Tintamei Siong'o as part of the August Cohort Hackathon. The portfolio demonstrates my skills in web development and data visualization using Excel and Power BI.

Portfolio Overview
The portfolio section showcases some of my projects with an interactive design. Each portfolio item includes a description and a visual representation (either an image or a dataset visualization). These items were created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for smooth animations and a modern user experience.

Features:
Responsive Design: The portfolio is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
Interactive Grid Layout: Projects are displayed in a grid format, which expands and reveals more information on hover.
3D Flip Animation: Each portfolio card has a 3D flip animation that provides a dynamic and engaging user experience.
Project Descriptions: Each project includes a detailed description, including the tools and technologies used.
Included Projects:
Excel Projects:
A collection of my data analysis and reporting projects done in Microsoft Excel, featuring complex formulas, pivot tables, and data visualizations.

Power BI Visualizations:
Interactive dashboards and reports created using Power BI. These visualizations highlight my ability to work with large datasets and provide meaningful insights through dynamic visuals.

Code Highlights:
The portfolio uses a grid system to organize the layout, and CSS3 transitions and transformations for hover effects. Below is a high-level view of the project structure:
