# August Cohort Hackathon 1 - Portfolio Section

This repository contains a portfolio section added by **Musa Tintamei Siong'o** as part of the August Cohort Hackathon. The portfolio demonstrates my skills in web development and data visualization using **Excel** and **Power BI**.

## Portfolio Overview

The portfolio section showcases some of my projects with an interactive design. Each portfolio item includes a description and a visual representation (either an image or a dataset visualization). These items were created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for smooth animations and a modern user experience.

### Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Grid Layout**: Projects are displayed in a grid format, which expands and reveals more information on hover.
- **3D Flip Animation**: Each portfolio card has a 3D flip animation that provides a dynamic and engaging user experience.
- **Project Descriptions**: Each project includes a detailed description, including the tools and technologies used.

### Included Projects:
1. **Excel Projects**:  
   A collection of my data analysis and reporting projects done in Microsoft Excel, featuring complex formulas, pivot tables, and data visualizations.
   
2. **Power BI Visualizations**:  
   Interactive dashboards and reports created using Power BI. These visualizations highlight my ability to work with large datasets and provide meaningful insights through dynamic visuals.

### Code Highlights:
The portfolio uses a grid system to organize the layout, and CSS3 transitions and transformations for hover effects. Below is a high-level view of the project structure:
